Theme of the dare 'Start with nothing'

Core game idea is to have the player be a wizard/baker that can summon canday units. The player will start with nothing and have to collect resources. Once resources are collected the player can create units to attack other nearby camps to claim more resources. The goal is to own the entire map.
